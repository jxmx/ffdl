Description: Firefly Logger webapp for use at ARRL Field Day operating events.
 The design of this logger is to be a simple, effective logger that can be
 used on any device that can have a reasonably modern browser installed on 
 it. This includes older laptops running Linux + Chromium, tablets with Chrome
 or Firefox, Rasperry Pi 3 or 4 with Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian), etc.
